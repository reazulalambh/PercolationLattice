# PercolationLattice

Explosivesitepercolation.cpp is for wrapping probability for site percolation \n
site_opentropy.cpp is for order parameter and entropy for site percolation\\
bondpercolation.cpp is for wrapping probability for bond percolation\\
op_entropy.cpp is for order parameter and entropy for bond percolation\\

in site percolation order parameter and entropy calculation, ptr is used for bonds.
