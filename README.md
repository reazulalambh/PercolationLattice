# PercolationLattice

Explosivesitepercolation.cpp is for wrapping probability for site percolation <br />
site_opentropy.cpp is for order parameter and entropy for site percolation <br />
bondpercolation.cpp is for wrapping probability for bond percolation <br />
op_entropy.cpp is for order parameter and entropy for bond percolation <br />

in site percolation order parameter and entropy calculation, ptr is used for bonds.
