# PercolationLattice

Explosivesitepercolation.cpp is for wrapping probability for site percolation <br />
site_opentropy.cpp is for order parameter and entropy for site percolation <br />
bondpercolation.cpp is for wrapping probability for bond percolation <br />
op_entropy.cpp is for order parameter and entropy for bond percolation <br />

in site percolation order parameter and entropy calculation, ptr is used for bonds.

boltzmann.cpp is for measuring boltzmann entropy for bond percolation.
bond_nsdf.cpp is for measuring cluster size distribution at critical point and fractal dimension of the percolating cluster for bond_percolation
secondlargest.cpp is for measuring second largest cluster size for bond percolation(regular and explosive).
